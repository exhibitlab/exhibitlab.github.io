Note: the home page header and footer should always be updated with the latest
alterations, so the user should be able to copy paste the header and footer from
the home page to the rest of the pages' html. Please be aware that any alterations
to the header or footer will have to be made to all html pages.

Note: in case of css within the html, there will be a note of that below the respective
section. However, icons will usually have the css within the html.

Note: All the pages that have the standard heading will have the crsbfslide1.css and the circle.css. Yes, I could have renamed it something more relevant, but that was too much work

Note: There are a bunch of <br> in the html, simply because it was easier to stick a <br> instead of playing with the margin/padding
